# DevOps Project

Welcome.. 

This is the final project in our course "Intro to DevOps" - Nov 2022.

It demonestrates our understanding of docker and docker compose, and how containers are made, and how they communicate with each other.

To setup the project environment and run docker compose simply type this in the bash terminal:

$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alwisidi/tuwaiq_devops_project/main/setup.sh)"

I hope you would find it usefull and fruitfull.

Best of luck :)
